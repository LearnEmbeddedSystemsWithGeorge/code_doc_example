/** @defgroup Division division.c
 * Division, denoted by the symbols ÷ or /, is essentially the inverse operation
 * to multiplication. Division finds the quotient of two numbers, the dividend
 * divided by the divisor. Any dividend divided by zero is undefined.
 * For distinct positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor,
 * the quotient is greater than 1, otherwise it is less than 1 (a similar rule
 * applies for negative numbers). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always
 * yields the dividend.\n
