 * Subtraction, denoted by the symbol −, is the inverse operation to addition.
 * Subtraction finds the difference between two numbers, the minuend minus
 * the subtrahend: D = M − S. Resorting to the previously established addition,
 * this is to say that the difference is the number that, when added to the subtrahend,
 * results in the minuend: D + S = M.\n
